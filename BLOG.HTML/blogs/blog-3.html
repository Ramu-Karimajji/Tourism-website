                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986. Notable for its lotus-like shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification.</b><br><br>
                            <center><img src="../assets/Blog 3/lotus2.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baháʼí Faith teaches that a Baháʼí House of Worship should be a space for people of all religions to gather, reflect, and worship. Anyone may enter the Lotus Temple irrespective of religious background, gender, or other distinctions, as is the case with all Baháʼí Houses of Worship.[<br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred writings of not only the Baháʼí Faith but also other religions can be read and/or chanted, regardless of language;on the other hand, reading nonscriptural texts is forbidden, as are delivering sermons or lectures, or fundraising. Musical renditions of readings and prayers can be sung by choirs, but no musical instruments can be played inside. There is no set pattern for worship services, and ritualistic ceremonies are not permitted.<br><br>
                            <b>Best Time To Visit Lotus Temple</b><br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is open six days a week except for Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. It is best to visit Lotus temple in the evening time, as it is illuminated with lights and looks spectacular. The scene of a temple lit with sparkling lights is really a breathtaking view.<br><br>

                            <center><img src="../assets/Blog 3/lotus3.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla, California, after spending some years in Canada.He was approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction.<br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone for the Lotus Temple on 19 October 1977 and dedicated the temple on 24 December 1986. For the dedication, there was a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including some 4,000 Baháʼís from 22 provinces in India. The temple was opened to the public on 1 January 1987 and more than 10,000 people visited that day.<br><br>
                            <b>Interesting Facts About Lotus Temple</b><br><br>
                            <center><img src="../assets/Blog 3/lotus5.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Baháʼí Houses of Worship, including the Lotus Temple, share certain architectural elements, some of which are specified by Baháʼí scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote that Baháʼí Houses of Worship must be nine-sided and circular. While all current Baháʼí Houses of Worship have a dome, this is not regarded as an essential part of their architecture.<br><br>
                            <ul style="flex-direction: column; list-style-type: disc;">
                                <li> Baháʼí scripture also states that no pictures, statues or images be displayed within the House of Worship, and no pulpits or altars be incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand behind simple portable lecture stands).
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Inspired by the lotus flower, the design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides. The temple's shape has symbolic and inter-religious significance because the lotus is often associated with purity, sacredness, spirituality, and knowledge.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    It has a spiritual significance in India. The nine doors of the Lotus Temple open onto a central hall 34.3 meters tall that can seat 1,300 people and hold up to 2,500 in all. The temple has a diameter of 70 m. The surface of the House of Worship is made of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble used in the construction of many ancient monuments (including the Parthenon) and other Baháʼí buildings. Along with its nine surrounding ponds and gardens, the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m2; 10.5 ha).An educational centre beside the temple was established in 2017.

                                    The Lotus Temple is situated near Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir metro station is just 500 meters away. It is in the village of Bahapur in New Delhi, National Capital Territory of Delhi, near Nehru Place

                                    The temple's total electricity use of 500 kilowatts (kW), 120 kW is provided by solar power generated by solar panels on the building.This saves the temple ₹120,000 per month.It is the first temple in Delhi to use solar power

                                    As is the case with other stone monuments such as the Taj Mahal, the Lotus Temple is becoming discoloured due to air pollution in India. Specifically, the white marble is turning grey and yellow due to pollution from vehicles and manufacturing in the city, among other sources.

                                    By late 2001, The Lotus Temple had attracted more than 70 million visitors, according to Manpreet Brar, a CNN reporter. The permanent delegation of India to UNESCO stated that the Lotus Temple had received over 100 million visitors by April 2014.

                                    The Lotus Temple has become a major attraction for people of various religions, with up to 100,000 visitors on some holidays. Estimates for the number of visitors annually range from 2.5 million to 5 million. Brar stated in 2001 that it was the "most visited building in the world". The Lotus Temple is often listed as one of Delhi's main tourist attractions.
